# Solod: Go can be a better C

Solod (**So**) is a strict subset of Go that transpiles to regular C. Write programs in Go — with its type safety, tooling, and clean syntax — and get plain C11 code you can read, debug, and ship without a runtime.

Highlights:

- Go in, C out. You write regular Go code and get readable C11 as output.
- Zero runtime. No garbage collection, no reference counting, no hidden allocations.
- Everything is stack-allocated by default. Heap is opt-in through the standard library.
- Native C interop. Call C from So and So from C — no CGO, no overhead.
- Go tooling works out of the box — syntax highlighting, LSP, linting and "go test".

So supports structs, methods, interfaces, slices, multiple returns, and defer. To keep things simple, there are no maps, channels, goroutines, closures, or generics.

So is for systems programming in C, but with Go's syntax, type safety, and tooling.

## Example

This Go code in a file `main.go`:

```go
package main

type Person struct {
    Name string
    Age  int
    Nums [3]int
}

func (p *Person) Sleep() int {
    p.Age += 1
    return p.Age
}

func main() {
    p := Person{Name: "Alice", Age: 30}
    p.Sleep()
    println(p.Name, "is now", p.Age, "years old.")

    p.Nums[0] = 42
    println("1st lucky number is", p.Nums[0])
}
```

Translates to a header file `main.h`:

```c
#pragma once
#include "so/builtin/builtin.h"

typedef struct main_Person {
    so_String Name;
    so_int Age;
    so_int Nums[3];
} main_Person;

so_int main_Person_Sleep(void* self);
```

Plus an implementation file `main.c`:

```c
#include "main.h"

so_int main_Person_Sleep(void* self) {
    main_Person* p = (main_Person*)self;
    p->Age += 1;
    return p->Age;
}

int main(void) {
    main_Person p = (main_Person){.Name = so_str("Alice"), .Age = 30};
    main_Person_Sleep(&p);
    so_println("%.*s %s %" PRId64 " %s", p.Name.len, p.Name.ptr, "is now", p.Age, "years old.");
    p.Nums[0] = 42;
    so_println("%s %" PRId64, "1st lucky number is", p.Nums[0]);
}
```

## Installation and usage

Install the So command line tool:

```
go install github.com/nalgeon/solod/cmd/so@latest
```

Create a new Go project and add the Solod dependency to use the So standard library:

```
go mod init example
go get github.com/nalgeon/solod@latest
```

Write regular Go code, but use So packages instead of the standard Go packages:

```go
package main

import "github.com/nalgeon/solod/so/c/math"

func main() {
    ans := math.Sqrt(1764)
    println("Hello, world! The answer is", int(ans))
}
```

Transpile to C:

```
so translate -o generated .
```

The translated C code will be saved in the `generated` directory.

You can also transpile to C and compile the code to a binary in one step. This uses the C compiler set by the `CC` environment variable:

```
so build -o main .
```

Or you can transpile, compile, and run without saving the binary:

```
so run .
```

All commands work with Go modules, not individual files (`so run .`, not `so run main.go`).

Keep in mind that So is new, so it's still a bit rough around the edges.

## Testing

So doesn't have its own testing framework. Since So code is valid Go code, you can just use `go test` like you normally would. Plus, your tests can use all Go features because they're never transpiled.

The transpilation logic is covered by the So compiler's own tests.

## Compatibility

So generates C11 code that relies on several GCC/Clang extensions:

- Binary literals (`0b1010`) in generated code.
- Statement expressions (`({...})`) in macros.
- Empty struct initializer (`{}`) in slices.
- `__attribute__((cleanup))` for defer support.
- `__auto_type` for local type inference in generated code.
- `__COUNTER__` for generating unique variable names.
- `__typeof__` for type inference in generic macros.
- `alloca` for `make()` and other dynamic stack allocations.

You can use GCC, Clang, or `zig cc` to compile the transpiled C code. MSVC is not supported.

Supported operating systems: Linux, macOS, Windows.

## Design decisions

_Simplicity is key_. Fewer features are always better. Every new feature is strongly discouraged by default and should be added only if there are very convincing real-world use cases to support it.

_No heap allocations_ are allowed in language built-ins (like maps, slices, new, or append). Heap allocations are allowed in the standard library, but they must clearly state when an allocation happens and who owns the allocated data.

_Fast and easy C interop_. Even though So uses Go syntax, it's basically C with its own standard library. Calling C from So, and So from C, should always be simple to write and run efficiently. The So standard library (compiled to C) should be easy to add to any C project.

_Readability_. There are several languages that claim they can transpile to readable C code. Unfortunately, the C code they generate is usually unreadable or barely readable at best. So isn't perfect in this area either (though it's arguably better than others), but it aims to produce C code that's as readable as possible.

_Go compatibility_. So code is valid Go code. No exceptions.

Non-goals:

- Raw performance. You can definitely write C code by hand that runs faster than code produced by So. Also, some features in So, like interfaces, are currently implemented in a way that's not very efficient, mainly to keep things simple.
- Go feature parity. Less is more. Iterators aren't coming, and neither are generic methods.

## Frequently asked questions

_Why not Rust/Zig/Odin/other language?_

Because I like C and Go.

_Why not TinyGo?_

TinyGo is lightweight, but it still has a garbage collector, a runtime, and aims to support all Go features. What I'm after is something even simpler, with no runtime at all, source-level C interop, and eventually, Go's standard library ported to plain C so it can be used in regular C projects.

_How does So handle memory?_

Everything is stack-allocated by default. There's no garbage collector or reference counting. The standard library provides explicit heap allocation when you need it.

_Is it safe?_

So itself has few safeguards other than the default Go type checking. It will panic on out-of-bounds array access, but it won't stop you from returning a dangling pointer or forgetting to free allocated memory.

Most memory-related problems can be caught with AddressSanitizer in modern compilers, so I recommend enabling it during development by adding `-fsanitize=address` to your `CFLAGS`.

_Can I use So code from C (and vice versa)?_

Yes. So compiles to plain C, therefore calling So from C is just calling C from C. Calling C from So is equally straightforward — see the [spec](doc/spec.md#c-interop) for details.

_Can I compile existing Go packages with So?_

Not really. Go uses automatic memory management, while So uses manual memory management. So also supports far fewer features than Go. Neither Go's standard library nor third-party packages will work with So without changes.

_How stable is this?_

Not for production at the moment.

_Where's the standard library?_

There are low-level packages that wrap the libc API (`so/c/stdlib`, `so/c/stdio`, `so/c/cstring`, ...), and a growing set of high-level packages (`so/bytes`, `so/mem`, `so/slices`, ...). Check out the [stdlib](doc/stdlib.md) document for a quick overview, or see the full [package documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/nalgeon/solod/so) for more details.

## Roadmap

✅ Transpiler with basic Go features.

✅ Low-level stdlib (libc wrappers). Done for now; I will add more if needed.

⏳ Core stdlib packages: fmt, io, strings, time, ...

⬜ Hardened transpiler.

⬜ Real-world examples.

⬜ More stdlib packages: crypto, http, json, ...

## Contributing

Bug fixes are welcome. For anything other than bug fixes, please open an issue first to discuss your proposed changes. To prevent feature bloat, it's important to discuss any new features before adding them.

AI-assisted submissions are fine on one condition: you, the human, have read all the code and fully understand what it does. Code reviewed only by another AI will not suffice.

Make sure to add or update tests as needed.
