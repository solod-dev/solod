# Changelog

This document outlines the main changes in different So versions.

## v0.3 (in progress)

### Language

**Type declaration order**. Types are now emitted in dependency order, so a type can use a type declared later in the source:

```go
type Rect struct {
    Min, Max Point // Point is declared below
}

type Point struct {
    X, Y int
}
```

**Promoted symbols**. The `//so:promote` directive promotes an unexported type, function, method, var, or const into the package header with the package prefix. This lets an exported inline function or type reference an unexported one without exporting it and polluting the public API:

```go
type Stats struct { c counter }

//so:inline
func NewStats() Stats {
	return Stats{c: newCounter()}
}

//so:promote
type counter struct { val int }

//so:promote
func newCounter() counter { ... }
```

[4dc1364](https://github.com/solod-dev/solod/commit/4dc1364488e125f2e96b57d4cffcdce32aa8805a)

**Anonymous functions**. You can now use anonymous functions as variable types and function parameters:

```go
// func parameter
func apply(n int, f func(int) int) int { return f(n) }

// func variable
var fn func(int) int = calc
```

[d926b2a](https://github.com/solod-dev/solod/commit/d926b2a56f5f56fd22a9b580a929cb5159236b0c)

### Safety

**Escape analysis**. If a function tries to return a stack-allocated value, the program won't compile:

```go
type Point struct{ x, y int }

func newPoint(x, y int) *Point {
    return &Point{x: x, y: y}
	//     |
	// compile-time error: stack-allocated
	// value escapes function frame
}

func main() {
    p := newPoint(3, 4)
    println(p.x, p.y)
}
```

The check isn't thorough and only covers a few common cases.

[3f2a2cc](https://github.com/solod-dev/solod/commit/3f2a2cc0afc13c2fc1eb66cbaa34c50581f72a97)

**Diagnosable assertions**. Assertions (slice bounds, index out of range, slice-to-array length, ...) and `c.Assert` now panic instead of calling C's `assert`. They go through a single `so_assert` macro, so a failure reports the calling function and honors `-panic=trace`:

```text
panic: index out of range
  main.c:10 (func boundsFail)
0   app    0x00000001045f7264 boundsFail + 160
1   app    0x00000001045f716c main + 448
```

Defining `NDEBUG` removes assertions. Other runtime checks, like calling `append` beyond capacity, still panic.

[2f86ef3](https://github.com/solod-dev/solod/commit/2f86ef33f739f4d211ea33faf8bf517e9cf37b3b)

**Stack traces**. The `panic` flag controls how a panic terminates the program: `trace` (default) prints a stack trace before exiting, `exit` calls `exit(1)`, and `abort` raises `SIGABRT` for a debugger or core dump. The default fits glibc and macOS; on musl (empty trace) or freestanding (always traps) pass `-panic=exit` or `-panic=abort`. See [building](building.md).

[8ed7f48](https://github.com/solod-dev/solod/commit/8ed7f48e66d2632d55309f810072617ee22b80ac)

**Nil checks**. A nil pointer dereference (or other invalid memory access) is now caught at runtime in POSIX hosted builds and reported as a panic that honors `-panic`, rather than emitting a per-dereference check that clutters the generated C.

⚠️ This removes the `-check-nil` flag.

[b829c4f](https://github.com/solod-dev/solod/commit/b829c4f77bb2b8880ea5a3a96caf5a273c99e1b1)

**Divide-by-zero checks**. Integer division or modulo by a zero divisor now panics instead of relying on hardware. This closes a portability gap: division by zero is undefined in C, and on arm64 it silently yields 0 rather than trapping.

[af173d8](https://github.com/solod-dev/solod/commit/af173d8e7975327a0994a4bc8eb982a3aa24995d)

**Sanitizer flag**. The `-sanitize` flag turns on C sanitizers for `build` and other commands. Bare `-sanitize` enables `address,undefined`; a comma-separated list picks a specific set. See [building](building.md).

[f87f8f4](https://github.com/solod-dev/solod/commit/f87f8f4abc421661fefc0d5cdd8b25d43025939a)

**Reserved names**. Local variables and parameters whose names conflict with C keywords or macros (`long`, `bool`, ...) are now mangled automatically instead of producing invalid C. Reserved names as struct fields or package-level declarations are rejected instead.

[7f1bb70](https://github.com/solod-dev/solod/commit/7f1bb702ebb28e0fb6d941e428deb3d476eb7188)

### Standard library

**Concurrency tools**. The `conc` package provides basic tools for concurrent programming, backed by pthreads.

- `Chan[T]` — a thread-safe FIFO channel (buffered) or rendezvous (unbuffered).
- `Pool` — a bounded worker pool for fork-join parallelism.
- `Thread` — an operating system thread.

**Synchronization primitives**. The `sync` package provides basic synchronization primitives, backed by pthreads.

- `Cond` — a condition variable.
- `Mutex` — a mutual exclusion lock.
- `Once` — runs a function exactly once.

[f5ae958](https://github.com/solod-dev/solod/commit/f5ae958ba9ee34a135dc006f6d0b30063a3d1479)

**Atomic types**. The `sync/atomic` package provides lock-free atomic operations. Offers atomic values like `Int64`, `Uint64`, `Bool`, and `Pointer[T]`.

[71a49a0](https://github.com/solod-dev/solod/commit/71a49a0413622a4cc5a1f53e88d98fbcaceb3496)

**Low-level JSON API**. The `encoding/json` package provides token-level JSON encoding and decoding. With no reflection, there is no `Marshal`/`Unmarshal`; you read and write one token at a time using `Decoder` and `Encoder`. Both types support streaming and use minimal allocations.

[54161e2](https://github.com/solod-dev/solod/commit/54161e27f5d7bf08a80cc50d21bb1c063c8ccf23)

**Source locations**. The `runtime` package provides `FileName`, `Line` and `FuncName` to report the current source location.

[7f0a8c0](https://github.com/solod-dev/solod/commit/7f0a8c06483e133b499e207cceee0e866cdf404b)

**Test leak checking**. `testing.T` provides an `Allocator` method that returns a tracking allocator. A test fails if memory allocated through it is not freed by the time the test returns. See the [testing guide](testing.md).

[9440bf5](https://github.com/solod-dev/solod/commit/9440bf5ec011f0469aa0ff4d14386588304b499a)

### Tools

**Tests**. The `so test` command runs tests from a package's `test` subdirectory. It discovers `TestXxx(t *testing.T)` functions, generates a runner that dispatches them via `testing.RunTests`, and runs them. See the [testing guide](testing.md).

[ca13759](https://github.com/solod-dev/solod/commit/ca1375959866ca7fc7c0b38b60f5b84fd085e6bc) ·
[163afcb](https://github.com/solod-dev/solod/commit/163afcb8662359cb6b93a4043f4572b4bec64d7b)

**Benchmarks**. The `so bench` command runs benchmarks from a package's `bench` subdirectory, mirroring `so test`. It discovers `BenchmarkXxx(b *testing.B)` functions, generates a runner that dispatches them via `testing.RunBenchmarks` with the system allocator, and runs them. See the [testing guide](testing.md).

[c374069](https://github.com/solod-dev/solod/commit/c37406988e712a7f266c87990107d6f491a566f7) ·
[e042c23](https://github.com/solod-dev/solod/commit/e042c233b77c32d4e6e05e7dfbea8a9661e598c1) ·
[2bc8dd9](https://github.com/solod-dev/solod/commit/2bc8dd90ce321b6bd36f9ac9cb13350021bc0e3f)

**Automatic linking**. The `so:link` directive declares which C library a package requires. `so build` and other commands collect these across all transpiled packages and pass them to the C compiler. The standard library already uses `so:link`, so importing `so/math` links `-lm` and `so/sync` or `so/conc` links `-lpthread` without setting `LDFLAGS` by hand. See the [interop guide](interop.md#linking).
