- `HasPrefix` and `HasSuffix` report whether a slice begins/ends with a prefix/suffix.
- `Index` and `IndexByte` search for a subslice or byte within a slice.
- `Join` concatenates slices with a separator.
- `Replace` replaces occurrences of a subslice within a slice.
- `Runes` converts a byte slice to a rune slice.
- `Split` and `SplitN` split a slice into subslices.

## [so/errors](https://pkg.go.dev/solod.dev/so/errors)

Error creation from text messages.

- `New(text string) error` - create a new error with the given message.

So only supports sentinel errors, which are defined at the package level using `New`.

## [so/fmt](https://pkg.go.dev/solod.dev/so/fmt)
