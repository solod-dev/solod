# Changelog

This document outlines the main changes in different So versions.

## v0.3 (in progress)

`conc` package: basic primitives for concurrent programming, backed by pthreads.

- `Chan[T]` — a thread-safe FIFO channel (buffered) or rendezvous (unbuffered).
- `Pool` — a bounded worker pool for fork-join parallelism.
- `Thread` — an operating system thread.

`sync` package: basic synchronization primitives, backed by pthreads.

- `Cond` — a condition variable.
- `Mutex` — a mutual exclusion lock.
- `Once` — runs a function exactly once.

You can now use anonymous functions as variable types and function parameters:

```go
// func parameter
func apply(n int, f func(int) int) int { return f(n) }

// func variable
var fn func(int) int = calc
```

## v0.2

Networking, new targets, and friendlier interop.

### Language

New directives: `so:volatile`, `so:thread_local`, `so:attr`.<br>
[600e881](https://github.com/solod-dev/solod/commit/600e881fe72cf5f9857745b489c6dedf9a864ea3)

Implement `error` as a regular interface (it was special-cased before).<br>
[6c8f0bd](https://github.com/solod-dev/solod/commit/6c8f0bd68e4ba8693d22be59f763676889270070)

Type aliases.<br>
[deeccb9](https://github.com/solod-dev/solod/commit/deeccb98d22f342e6bdceb9d7827e9d464af9603)

⚠️ Auto-generate result types for `(T, error)` multi-return values where `T` is a custom struct type. This is a breaking change: previously, you had to manually define a `T{Result}` type for any such `T`.<br>
[745b174](https://github.com/solod-dev/solod/commit/745b174e11c08bee91cdaeaf8a8b2aa083863b61)

⚠️ Block-scoped `defer` is no longer supported. This is a breaking change.<br>
